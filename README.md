Distributed Logging Systems
===========================

### Purpose
This repository contains a set of test used to check out the features and advantages provided by some of the technologies studied at the laboratory, regarding loggers which let you know the state of a whole distributed system divided in several remote machines.


### Technologies

After been searching and analyzing a bunch of several technologies, we were able to find 8 great distributed logging tools.
The next list contains the 3 tools that we considered the most interesting over the rest:

* [Flume](https://github.com/cloudera/flume) (Cloudera) 
* [Fluentd](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/) (Treasure Data)
* [Winston](https://github.com/flatiron/winston/) (Nodejitsu)

Also, here is a list with the rest of technologies that were studied but not included in the deep analysis:

* [Kafka](https://github.com/apache/kafka) (LinkedIn)
* [Chukwa](https://github.com/apache/chukwa)
* [Scribe](https://github.com/facebook/scribe) (Facebook)
* [Greg](https://github.com/jkff/greg)
