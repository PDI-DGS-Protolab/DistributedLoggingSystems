Fluentd
===========================

## Description
We implemented 3 different tests to check out the features provided by
Fluentd. The tests were developed in a local network but we tried to simulate
a proper real environment sending and delivering a very high amount of
data information.


### Test 1
The first test consisted

### Test 2


### Test 3


## Results


## Conclusions
We think Fluentd is a great technology due to it offers a mix of power and
simpleness.

It lacks of a 100% reliable delivery messages system. Therefore, it is not the
most appropiate tool for critical situations when you need every message gets
their destination.

But if you does not need such a high reliability level or just you need a
powerful tool with an easy, fast configuration, Fluentd will fits quite well with your development
